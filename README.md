# Weather Analysis

What's the weather like as we approach the equator? <br>
In theory, it should get hotter the closer one gets to the equator. **But, can we prove that?**

* Temperatures increase closer to the equator and decrease closer to the poles. There seems to be a fairly strong relationship between latitude and max temperature in the northern hemisphere. As latitude increases (closer to the poles) temperature decreases. Spread of data points is fairly consistent and linear, which we can see numerically from the r-squared value (0.71). There seems to be less of a relationship between latitude and max temperature in the southern hemisphere. As latitude decreases (closer to the poles) temperature does decrease. However, the spread of data points is less consistent than in NH which is indicative of its r-squared value (0.22).


* Humidity percentage is highly varied above and below the equator. There seems to be little relationship between latitude and humidity in the northern hemisphere. As latitude increases (closer to the poles) the spread of humidity percentages does decrease, but not by much. Data is not well correlated, which is supported by the r-squared value of 0.12. There seems to be little relationship between latitude and humidity in the southern hemisphere. As latitude decreases (closer to the poles) the spread of humidity percentages increases. Data is not well correlated, which is supported by the r-squared value of 0.12.

* Cloudiness percentage is highly varied above and below the equator. There seems to be little relationship between latitude and cloudiness in the northern hemisphere. Data is very randomly distributed (not well correlated), which is supported by the r-squared value of 0.011. Data is very randomly distributed (not well correlated), which is supported by the r-squared value of 0.13.


* Wind speed is fairly consistent above and below the equator, with some outliers in both the northern and southern hemispheres. R-squared value of 0.01 indicates there is little correlation between latitude and wind speed. Majority of wind speeds in the northern hemisphere are below 10 km/h. R-squared value of 0.02 indicates there is little correlation between latitude and wind speed. Majority of wind speeds in the southern hemisphere are below 6 km/h.
